# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images as **cats** or **dogs** using TensorFlow and Deep Learning techniques.

The model learns visual features such as edges, textures, and shapes to accurately distinguish between the two classes.
